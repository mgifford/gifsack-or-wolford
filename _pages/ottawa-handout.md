# Our Wedding Ceremony

## 5pm - Doors Open

## 5:45 - People are seated in a circle 
Please silence your phones.  
Two friends will be taking photos during the ceremony, please set your phones and cameras aside for this part of our celebration.

## 6:00 - Service will begin with a welcome from a First Nations Elder
It is important to us to acknowledge that Ottawa is in the traditional, unceded territories of the Algonquin nation.

## 6:05 - Quaker introduction by Caroline Balderston Parry
Caroline will be our guide for the next hour or so. Quakers have no clergy, this means there is no one person to “marry” us. We will declare our intentions before our community and everyone will be a witness. This will be a new experience for many of us, Caroline will help guide us through it.

## 6:10 - Exchange of vows by Rebecca and Mike
Mike and Rebecca will declare vows to each other and exchange rings.

## 6:30 - Moment of silence, followed by silence and reflections from you
Silence in Quaker meetings is appreciated. After an initial moment of silence, guests are encouraged to stand to say a few words or voice support or advice for the couple. Please make sure to leave some silence after someone else speaks before standing to speak yourself. Please do not repeat messages that others have said. Keep in mind that there is time for roasts & toasts after the ceremony.

## 7:15 - Ceremony ends with the rise of Elders. 
we will all rise, following the lead of the elders. We will ask everyone to move into the middle of the room and look up for a group photo - Susanne will be on the balconey ready to capture the moment. Mike and Rebecca will then sign the Quaker wedding certificate. 

## 7:20 - Everyone Signs the Ceremonial Certificate 
Everyone needs to sign the certificate please - all guests of all ages. From now on, please feel free to snap as many photos as you like. Please share them with us. If you put them on social media, please use the hashtag #RandMnews so we can find it. Desserts and drinks will be served, a cashbar is also open. Family members will sneak away for about 20 minutes at this time for a few group photos. If you brought a message for Mike and Rebecca or wish to write one down, look for the table at the back of the room with the paper, pens and box.

## 8:00 - Roasts & Toasts
This is your opportunity to tell hilarious or embarassing or tear jerking stories. Or to sign us a song. If you want some time at the mic, can you please let Chad Nelson know? He can be reached at: chad.nelson@sympatico.ca
