Since traditionally Quakers have no clergy, there is no one person to “marry” us. We will declare our intentions before our community and everyone present will be a witness.

Mike and Rebecca will declare vows to each other and exchange rings.

Silence in Quaker meetings is appreciated. Guests are encouarged to stand to say a few words or voice support for the couple (think: heartfelt toasts).
