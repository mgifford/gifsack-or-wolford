# West Vanouver Reception (& next day walk)

## Beach Reception

We will be having a drink oceanside on September 1st!
2-6pm
[8815 Lawrence Way, West Vancouver](https://www.google.com/maps/place/8815+Lawrence+Way,+West+Vancouver,+BC+V7W+2T7/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54866940036f6e11:0x3091d0c4ef57a0ba?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVsM7czszaAhWFw4MKHalGBzoQ8gEIKDAA)

For us this is a chance to celebrate with folks who aren’t traveling to Ottawa for the wedding - and to celebrate again with some of you who are coming to both! Rebecca’s dad and step-mum – Joost and Jane - will be hosting at their beautiful home. 
There will be drinks and nibbles! We will talk a bit about the wedding (we will say our short vows again) and make a few toasts. We will also be asking you to sign a part of our Quaker wedding certificate – this is a beautiful part of the Quaker wedding tradition that we are extending. The idea is that loved ones sign the certificate to say that you witnessed our commitment to each other and you commit to supporting our relationship. 

What to wear? Whatever feels celebratory and works for you outside (if it is raining we will be indoors.) If you are bringing kids and it is a hot day, you might want to bring swimsuits and towells.

Just a heads up: Hannah the doodle and Tibi the whoodle will be there. And probably other dogs from the hood will drop by.

### The Next Day
Sunday, September 2.
10am 

We are going to take the sea to sky gondala at probably 10am on Sunday morning and would love it if you could join us! We will have walk and a snack in the mountains, then come back down. We will post more info here on timing and tickets closer to the time.
