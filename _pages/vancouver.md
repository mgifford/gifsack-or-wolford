## West Vanouver Reception **(& next day walk, below)**


## Beach Reception

<p>
We will be having a drink oceanside on September 1st!
<br />
2-6pm
<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/8815+Lawrence+Way,+West+Vancouver,+BC+V7W+2T7/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54866940036f6e11:0x3091d0c4ef57a0ba?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVsM7czszaAhWFw4MKHalGBzoQ8gEIKDAA">8815 Lawrence Way, West Vancouver</a> (There will be signs for parking instructions)
</p>

For us, this is a chance to celebrate with folks who aren’t traveling to Ottawa for the wedding - and to celebrate again with some of you who are coming to both! Rebecca’s dad and step-mum – Joost and Jane - will be hosting at their beautiful home. 
There will be drinks and nibbles! We will talk a bit about the wedding (we will say our short vows again) and make a few toasts. We will also be asking you to sign a part of our Quaker wedding certificate – this is a beautiful part of the Quaker wedding tradition that we are extending. The idea is that loved ones sign the certificate to say that you witnessed our commitment to each other and you commit to supporting our relationship. 

What to wear? Whatever feels celebratory and works for you outside (if it is raining we will be indoors.) If you are bringing kids and it is a hot day, you might want to bring swimsuits and towels.

Just a heads up: Hannah the doodle and Tibi the whoodle will be there. And probably other **dogs** from the hood will drop by.

**A note on Transport/Parking/Mobility issues**
The house is at the bottom of a very steep driveway. You are welcome to drive down and drop people off at the front door and then go back up to the street to find parking. The driveway will not be easy walking for some people. If you have mobility concerns please talk with us (we can probably sort out access for you via a neighbour.)

There is no public transport to the house, or nearby. There is somewhat limited parking (although the neighbours are all being lovely about this). If it is possible for you, please car pool!

### The Next Day

<p>
Sunday, September 2, 10am 
<br />
<a href="https://www.seatoskygondola.com/visit/how-get-here">36800 BC-99, Squamish BC</a>
</p>  
We are going to take the [Sea to Sky Gondala](https://www.seatoskygondola.com/) at probably 10am on Sunday morning and would love it if you could join us! We will have a walk and snack in the mountains, then come back down. It costs a little less if you buy your tickets in advance (online) but you can also buy tickets on the day. It is not super cheap but it is supposed to be super beautiful! We are likely to spend the whole morning up there, come join us when you can! If you can't find us, call Mike at 613 327 8537
