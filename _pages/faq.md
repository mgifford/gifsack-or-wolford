## What is a Quaker wedding?

Quaker weddings do not have a priest or pastor presiding over the ceremony - as a community this is up to us. There will be Quakers who will guide us through this process. They will ensure Mike and Rebecca jump through the legal hoops, and ensure those of us who feel inspired can speak. We will sit in a circle in silence, and if you feel inspired to speak you will stand and speak (keeping an eye out in case someone else stands first). In most Quaker weddings, a lot of people want to have an opportunity to share something. Some general guidance rules might be helpful:
-	only speak once if possible
-	do not to speak for very long
-	do not repeat what someone else has already shared (this is a common problem at weddings, everyone wants to jump up and say congratulations, or donâ€™t go to bed angry, but keep in mind there is time later to chat with the newlyweds).

Although it is uncomfortable for some at first, it is important to leave space for silence between speakers. Silence gives us all a chance to reflect on what was said.
 

## What is a Quaker?

[Quakers](http://quaker.ca/who-we-are/beliefs/) are a religious community that generally believe in the ability of each person access what some refer to as "the light within". It is generally considered to be a Christian community, but includes people from all religious traditions as well as those who are agnostic or athiest. The guiding principles of most Quakers are [peace, equality, simplicity and truth](https://www.quaker.org.uk/about-quakers/our-values). 

## What is a Quaker Wedding Certificate?

At the end of each of our events we will be asking you to sign our Wedding Certificate. This is not a legal document, but one that we will have on our wall as a memory of our committment to each other and the family and friends that support us. We will encourage everyone to sign the document once. This is an indication that you witnessed our commitment and (for those who can) are committed to helping us maintain a lifetime bond. Those who can not yet write are encourgaed to leave a thumb or paw print.

## What to wear?

We are going to get dressed up. We want you to be comfortable and to feel great. Now might be the perfect time to pull out those sequins, or not, depending on you. We have often joked about fusing our names (well, this was only partly a joke for one of us - it seems like a cool idea to one of us.) In our case, this leaves us with the unfortunate choice of the rather posh Wolford or the somewhat less posh Giffsak. We think you can use these two names for outfit inspiration. Maybe you are more of a Giffsak and you want to wear those yellow shorts and the hawaiian shirt. Yay! We are excited to see it. Or maybe you want to wear your Wolford gown. Go for it.

As we said, we will be a bit dressy. But the most important thing to us is that you are comfy. And ready to dance, if the inspiration hits you. It is likley to be a hot and humid day, but there will be air conditioning.

## What will the weather be like?

We're Canadian - we must talk about the weather! July average high is 26 and low of 15, it is usually pretty humid. One of the advantages of having the wedding at Wabano is that we do not have to worry about the weather. The space is big, there are lots of windows and there is air conditioning. In late July in Ottawa it can be super hot and humid, it could also pour with rain all day long, who knows what will happen. Because of the outdoor activities that we hope to do, we will be monitoring [the weather here,](https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-118_metric_e.html) but not stressing too much about it. Just keep the heat in mind if you are packing for here.

## Can I bring my kids or pets?

Kids yes, pets no. We love pets, but Wabano doesn't. 

If your kids know us and they want to celebrate with us, then we want to celebrate with them! Also of course if you are traveling from out of town and have your kids with you, feel free to bring them too. Keep in mind this is an after-dinner evening affair... Please get in touch with us about child care.  We will have a kid-friendly space, some childcare volunteers and some fun activities. We just need to be sure of the numbers.

## What about photos?

We will put photos up on flickr, if you have some photos to share we would love it if you added them to this [group too.](https://www.flickr.com/groups/randmnews/) If you don't want to use flickr you can send us the photos, or post them to this [Facebook group.](https://www.facebook.com/openconcept/media_set?set=a.10151068696649959.508164958&type=3&uploaded=1)

For the Ottawa ceremony, we have hired our talented and lovely friend Susanne to take photos throughout the evening and she will also have a fun photo booth set up. We ask that you set your cameras and phones aside for the ceremony itself, and let her be responsible for capturing it.

Not everyone likes having their photo taken. Some don't like to have their photos put up on the internet. There will be a lot of photos at this event, but do let us know and we'll try to keep you out of them.

## Do we bring gifts?

We are not spring chickens looking to build a new home, we have plenty of stuff. No gifts please! 

Our smart friend Andrew has given us a fun idea (which we have tweaked a little...) Rebecca is going to make an album/scrapbook full of photos, and various triggers for our memory, from all of our celebrations. **If you feel inspired** we would love you to bring a contribution to the book - it could be a picture you have drawn, a poem you have written, some sage or silly advice on relationships...whatever you want. We will have a box at each of the celebrations where you can drop off your contribution. We will also have some paper and pens, and perhaps a little glitter, beside the box in case inspiration hits you on the night.

## What if we want to make a donation?

**There is no need to make a donation.**  We understand that for some people, no gifts is uncomfortable and they want to do something.  If you are such a person, you could consider making a donation in our name to an organization like Inter Pares, Ecology Ottawa, or, for those in the US, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

## What is the hashtag?

We're going to use **#randmnews** as it is close to the website we are using.  Please use that hashtag if you are sharing things about this celebration on social media.

## What does RandM.news stand for?

Rebecca and Mike of course. It is easier to say than MandR.news and we didn't want it to get long and complicated.
