## What is a Quaker wedding?

## What to wear?

Clothes.

## Can I bring my kids or pets?

Kids yes, pets no. We love pets, but Wabino doesn't. 

With kids, please let us know if they will need child care.  We are going to hire someone and already have a number of volunteers that can help. We just need to be more sure of the numbers.

## Do we bring gifts?

We are not spring chickens looking to build a new home, we have plenty of stuff. No gifts please! 

## What if we want to make a donation?

There is no need to make a donation.  Some people like to give something to help this new phase of our lives.  If you are such a person, please consider making a donation in our name to an organization like Inter Pares, Ecology Ottawa, or the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

## What is the hashtag?

We're going to use **#randmnews** as it is close to the website we are using.  Please use that hashtag if you are sharing things about this celebration on social media.

## What does RandM.news stand for?

Rebecca and Mike of course. Was easier to say than MandR.news and we didn't want it to get long and complicated.
