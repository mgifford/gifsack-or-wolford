## The Wedding
  
The ceremony will begin at **6:00pm**. 

It will be a Quaker ceremony - don't panic! We will give you lots of info and guidance on the day. If you are curious, please see What is a Quaker Wedding Ceremony? in the [FAQ section](/f9f742e1f653a74c4cd78d7ea283b5556539b96b/faq/). 

The ceremony will last for about one hour. We will then all sign our wedding certificate and this will be closely followed by some toasts. We will then have some wine, desert and cheese - yum! There will be music  to boogie to, a photo booth to be goofy in and friends to chat with. We will have some prosecco, wine and juice - and a cash bar if you fancy something a bit different.

There will be a kids playing area and maybe some face painting and other activities. Hopefully the kids will be able to sit with us during the ceremony, but please do not worry if they grow impatient. We understand, it will be nice to have them there.

We have hired our talented and lovely friend Susanne to take photos throughout the evening and she will also have a fun photo booth set up. We ask that you set your cameras and phones aside for the ceremony and let her be responsible for capturing it.

The Wabano Centre for Aboriginal Health is an urban health centre that provides health services to First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis communities, promotes the health of all Aboriginal people and community-building through education and advocacy, and serves as a centre of excellence for urban Aboriginal health. They have a beautiful mission and a beautiful building. They rent their grand gathering space as an income-generating project and we are so happy to support their good work. 

## Pre-Wedding for Family & Out of Towners

### Friday Night (July 27) (Family & Out of Town)

Given that you are family and/or that you have travelled from afar, we would like to maximize this window of time with you. 

<p><em>Pizza & Beer @ 6pm Friday July 27 <br />

We would love to have you over for dinner at our home on Friday night (July 27). It will be a simple casual affair - pizza and salad in our backyard. We will have beer, wine, and juice no need to bring anything. As it is the night before the big day we will try to make this an early night :)

## Post-Wedding Activity for all

### Sunday afternoon (July 29) (Everyone Welcome!!)

**12:30**ish - **5pm**ish

Our only regret about having the wedding at Wabano is the lack of outdoors time. So we have decided to put on our wedding outfits on Sunday afternoon and head to Dows lake. Please join us with your cameras and some food for a potluck picnic in the park! It will be low key - we are not coordinating food. We would love some photos outside in the sun, so bring your camera/phone. We might even wear our outfits. 

We will be near the [willows just north of the bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/FRYu5AsRkC32) close to the canal by Carleton University. 

The weather people are predicting rain so we need a backup. There is a low chance of rain so we are going to the park. If you aren't sure text Mike - 613 327-8537.

We really wanted to make this a dog friendly day.

[Parking marked on map here](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Dominion+Arboretum/@45.3909884,-75.7039066,15z) or see the bottom of this page. We will hopefully be under a tree. 

## Map & Things to do in O-Town 

For a fairly small town, there is a lot to do. We made a map of relevant or interesting [places in Ottawa](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=19bKJw5R4ZpiY2VlZo6IpHQVXZttV71Nu&ll=45.41890687301883%2C-75.68983909074706&z=14) (we've also pasted it in below.)

[This website](http://apt613.ca/) also has some great info on things going on in town.
