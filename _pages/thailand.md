## Thailand Celebration

We plan to have our "honeymoon" on a beach in Thailand on Koh Mak December 28-Jan 5, and would love you to join for this adventure. We will be staying at [Cococape](http://www.kohmakcococape.com/) We have some beautiful friends who live in the region, and we want to celebrate with them. But if any of you live further afield and would like to join us, that would also be great. We are pretty confident it will be an amazing time.

Koh Mak is a small and beautiful island east of Bangkok nearish to Cambodia. It is about a five-hour bus journey and then a one-hour boat trip. We are happy to share lots of info to help you book your trip.

We hope to have a mini-ceremony/celebration on December 31st. We will talk a bit about the wedding (we will say our short vows again) and make a few toasts. We will also be asking you to sign a part of our Quaker wedding certificate â€“ this is a beautiful part of the Quaker wedding tradition that we are extending. The idea is that loved ones sign the certificate to say that you witnessed our commitment to each other and you commit to supporting our relationship. 

Mike & Rebecca will fly out of Ottawa on the 26th and land late at night on the 27th. So we are booked to be on the beach on the 28th. If you plan to join, please make sure we are in touch to ensure you have a bed. New Year's Eve is the busiest time of the entire year, so we must book beds ASAP. We have block booked a large number of rooms but wont be able to hold onto them for long.
